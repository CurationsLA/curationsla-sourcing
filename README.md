Hi CurationsLA AI Curator Team. Please see the below prompt for instructions as it pertains to Newsletter Sourcing for us at CurationsLA, which can be located on our new website that you can ping at https://la.curations.cc, with an archive that is also available on https://curatedla.beehiiv.com, with such archive not to confuse our old name in that of CuratedLA, as we are now known as CurationsLA. 

In addition to the sources and instructions below, I will provide you with the publication date for each initial prompt, for example, 'Source for July 31st, 2025' as a hypothetical example upon the first prompt within the task. 

Note: 
1. Please produce such output only herein within Github as a Markdown file so that I can easily copy and paste. These are all manual triggers and do not include any type of workflow. I have curated this repo specifically for our purposes.

2. Also, as it pertains to our purposes for this Repo, please include and add the appropriate subfolders. We do not have any subfolders yet, but the framework and organization of such subsfolders should be
3. YEAR
4. YEAR --> MONTH
5. YEAR ---- MONTH ---- DATE

6. As we continue to source, please refeer to this framework to remove duplicated content accordingly. Also, as this will be the master repo for sourcing, I am also relying on our Team to incorporate the best agents, a minimum of fifteen (15), those agents that are the best of the best as it pertains to identfiying content for us at CurationsLA, and in doing so, those agents will also identify all articles possible online, or any other means of sourcing any information as it pertains to Los Angeles, and will update such sources accordingly.

7. In the interim, let's try to shoot for twenty (20) sources and content blurbs based for each section:
8.   1. EATS

  PROMPT: 

  GITHUB AGENT INSTRUCTIONS / PROMPT
Purpose:
Identify, summarize, and produce one-paragraph, newsletter-ready blurbs for articles and news links drawn from the above sources (and similar reputable digital/social outlets).

No email templates, no direct subscriber outputâ€”just the file for use on Github.

Blurb Writing Style:
Write each blurb in the CurationsLA writing style, blended with Morning Brew:

Humanistic, concise, community centered

No hyphens or filler/casual suggestions

2â€“3 vivid, fact-driven sentences

Focus on cultural relevance, impact, or shared experience

Prioritize clarity, rhythm, observation, empathy, and readability

Always provide the main official homepage or digital presence (website, key social account, or press kit) for each company, outlet, or brand featured
